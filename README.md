# coolchat-discord-bot

A rather basic Discord bot based on discord.py and cogs to provide custom commands (mostly sports related) to the Cool Chat Discord guild.

## Usage

Don't.

## Commands

I'd rather you use the built-in help command to read about what commands the bot offers and how to use them.

e.g. `?help` or `?help <command>`
